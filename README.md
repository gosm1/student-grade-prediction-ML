# 🎓 Student Grade Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline that predicts student performance based on academic and behavioral data. It explores how ML can help identify students at risk and support early intervention.

## 📌 Overview

We use classification models to predict whether a student will succeed or struggle based on features such as attendance, study time, and more.

The process includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature importance visualization
- Prediction output

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

All models are trained and evaluated for comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
